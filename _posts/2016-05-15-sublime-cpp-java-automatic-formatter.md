Formatting source code is not only personal taste but is also an organizational descipline. 
We need automatic formatter to meet organizational requirements - often called as code convention.

#### cpp and java on sublime text

[Astyle](https://www.howtoinstall.co/en/ubuntu/trusty/astyle/) is a nice automattic formatter for c/c++ and java. Sublime has [SublimeAStyleFormatter](http://theo.im/SublimeAStyleFormatter/) package.
After installation, 'control+alt+f' on all operating systems reformats c++ and java source code.

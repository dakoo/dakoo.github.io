Business Plan checklist has to be powerful and simple. Usually, simpler checklist is more powerful.
In my opinion, clearly anwsering to the first two questions is the most important. 

- What is the problem?
- How has the problem been solved by your competitors and current solutions? Why is the problem still the matter?
- How will you solve the problem?
- How can you solve the problem better than your competitors? What is the evidence?
- If you can, how big is the market? Several millions or billions? Make projections of the market.

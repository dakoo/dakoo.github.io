## [Original](http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/yossi-feinberg-avoid-these-five-common-startup-traps)

- **ever neglect your target market**.
- **Don’t try and reinvent the wheel** if you don’t need to.
- Have a **solid business model** from the very beginning.
- Don’t be afraid to learn from your predecessors, competitors, and similar businesses in general.
- As hard as it may be, try to separate your natural emotion from your business concept.

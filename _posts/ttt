Top K Frequent Elements
https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/

- problem

Kth most frequent elements within O(NlogN) time complexity

- Approach

Use max-heap. After construct max-heap, in where the key of elements is the frequency, pop the elements k times. 

1. Construct hashmap to store the key and frequency.
2. Convert the hashmap into a heap.
3. Pop the items from the heap k times and push them to a vector.

- Complexity

Time complexity: O(NlogN) - heap


##### How to use STL heaps.
